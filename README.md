Restrict Content Pro Code Snippet Library
==========================================

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [Restrict Content Pro](http://restrictcontentpro.com).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

While these snippets are available for you to take and use on your site, they are considered custom code and we do not offer support for custom code at this time. For more information or to take a look at our [support policy](https://help.ithemes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008730948).

## Using Snippets

Most files in this library are set up to be WordPress plugins:

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.
3. Save the page from your browser to your wp-content/plugins folder and upload to your server. Alternatively you can compress the file as a .zip file and upload as a plugin from within WordPress. 
4. Activate the plugin from the WordPress plugins page.

For files that aren't set up as plugins follow steps 1 and 2 above and then copy and paste the code into your child theme's functions.php or place inside a custom functionality plugin.

If you need help customising any of the snippets or do not understand how to use them, we recommend [hiring an RCP consultant](http://restrictcontentpro.com/consultants/).
